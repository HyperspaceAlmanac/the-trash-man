This is a project for educational purposes only

# This project uses Google Maps API and Google Geocode API to retrieve longitude and latitude to display markes on map

# Notable code snippets taken from somewhere else:

1. Used this as reference for how to generate multiple markers on the same map.
Used the same logic of creating function for adding the markers, and then calling Html.Raw() to add the function calls to the scripts section.
